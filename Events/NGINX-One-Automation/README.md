# About NGINX One

The F5 NGINX One Console makes it easy to manage NGINX instances across locations and environments. The console lets you monitor and control your NGINX fleet from one placeâ€”you can check configurations, track performance metrics, identify security vulnerabilities, manage SSL certificates, and more.

NGINX One offers the following key benefits:

- Centralized control: Manage all your NGINX instances from a single console.
- Enhanced monitoring and risk detection: Automatically detect critical vulnerabilities (CVEs), verify SSL certificate statuses, and identify security issues in NGINX configurations.
- Performance optimization: Track your NGINX versions and receive recommendations for tuning your configurations for better performance.
- Graphical Metrics Display: Access a dashboard that shows key metrics for your NGINX instances, including instance availability, version distribution, system health, and utilization trends.
- Real-time alerts: Receive alerts about critical issues.
